abstract = {This paper presents an architecture for the navigation of an autonomous mobile robot evolving in an uncertain environment with obstacles. The proposed strategy consists in separating the path planning from the control algorithm. The path planning is done by computing the time optimal collision-free trajectory which takes into account the limitations on the linear and angular speeds of the vehicle. The position and shape of obstacles are computed by a vision algorithm using a single camera. A saturated controller based on integral sliding mode is designed to solve the tracking problem in the presence of input saturations and of the unknown disturbances. The effectiveness, perfect performance of obstacle avoidance, real-time and high robustness properties are demonstrated by experimental results.},

@article{Kelly2003,
abstract = {There are many situations for which a feasible nonholonomic motion plan must be generated immediately based on real-time perceptual information. Parametric trajectory representations limit computation because they reduce the search space for solutions (at the cost of potentially introducing suboptimality). The use of any parametric trajectory model converts the optimal control formulation into an equivalent nonlinear programming problem. In this paper, curvature polynomials of arbitrary order are used as the assumed form of solution. Polynomials sacrifice little in terms of spanning the set of feasible controls while permitting an expression of the general solution to the system dynamics in terms of decoupled quadratures. These quadratures are then readily linearized to express the necessary conditions for optimality. Resulting trajectories are convenient to manipulate and execute in vehicle controllers and they can be computed with a straightforward numerical procedure in real time.},
