\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}




%General Context

The %command and
control of mobile robots is a long-standing subject of research 
in the iterative robotics domain. A trending application of mobile robots systems
is its use in industrial supply-chains for processing orders and optimizing products storage and distribution. Companies such as Amazon and the logistic provider IDEA Groupe employ moble multi-robot systems (Kiva systems, Scallog) for autonomously processing clients orders~\cite{Gizmag,supplychain}.
%such as teams of autonomous forklift trucks
%(for instance Kiva robots used by Amazon~\cite{Gizmag},
%to improve their commercial performance,
Such logistics tasks became increasingly complex as uncertainties sources, such as human presence, are admitted in the work environment.

%Problem

One basic requirement for such mobile robot systems is the capacity of motion planning, i.e., generating admissible configuration and input trajectories that connects two arbitrary states. For solving the motion planning problem, different 
constraints must be taken into account, in particular:

\begin{itemize}

 \item robot's kinematic and dynamic constraints;

 \item geometric constraints;

% \item constraints associated with uncertainties about the current state of 
%world and the outcome of actions.

\end{itemize}

The first constraints derive directly from the mobile robot architecture 
implying, for example, in nonholonomic constraints and sliding phenomena.
Geometric 
constraints result from need of preventing the robot to assume specific configurations
in order to avoid collisions, communication lost, etc.
% the impossibility of the robots to assume some specific 
%configurations  due to the presence of obstacles, environment bounds, communication range, etc. 
%In turn, uncertainty constraints come from the impossibility of the robots to have an 
%absolute and complete perception of the world (including theirs own states) as 
%well as the outcome of non-stochastic events.


We are particularly interested in solving the problem of planning a 
trajectory for a team of nonholonomic mobile robots in a partially known 
environment occupied by static obstacles being near optimal with respect to the 
execution time (time spent from going from initial to goal configurations).


%State of Art

In recent years, a great amount of work towards collision-free trajectory 
planning has been proposed.

Some work has been done towards analytic methods for solving the problem for 
certain classes of systems (~\cite{})
TODO cite
. However~\cite{Schwartz1988} shows 
that analytic methods  are inapplicable for nonholonomic systems in presence of 
obstacles.


Cell decomposition methods, as presented in~\cite{Latombe1991}, have the 
downside of requiring a structured configuration space and an \textit{a priori} 
model of its connectivity. Besides, the cell decomposition reduces the space 
of admissible solutions.

 

Initially proposed in~\cite{Khatib1986}, the vector field obstacle avoidance 
method was improved along time for treating problems such as oscillation of the 
solution for narrow passages. This method does not present a near optimal 
generated trajectory.

 

Elastic band approach initially proposed by~\cite{Quinlan1994} and extended to 
mobile manipulators in~\cite{Brock et Khatib, 1998} uses approximations of the 
trajectory shape (combinations of arcs and straight lines) limiting the space 
of solutions and thus making this method inappropriate for really constrained 
environments.

 

The dynamic window approach~\cite{Fox1997} can handle trajectory 
planning for robots at high speeds and in presence of obstacles. But it is not 
flexible enough to be extended to a multi-robot system.

 

%What do we propose

In this paper, we focus on the development of a motion planning algorithm. 
This algorithm finds collision-free trajectories and computes the corresponding
angular and longitudinal velocities for a multi-robot system in 
presence of static obstacles perceived by the robots as they evolve 
in their environment. The dynamic trajectories computed are near optimal with 
respect to the total time spent going from the initial configuration to the 
final one. Besides, this algorithm uses a decentralized approach making the 
system more robust to communication outages and individual robot failure than 
compared to a centralized approach. Identified drawbacks are the dependence on 
several parameters for achieving real-time performance and good solution 
optimality, and the difficulty of handling dynamic obstacles as it is.

 

This algorithm is an extension of the work done in~\cite{Defoort2007a}. In particular,
improvements are proposed for the respect of a precise final configuration of the 
multi-robot system. Also, investigation about how to set parameters for achieving
satisfying solutions was performed.

\section{Problem Statement}\label{sec:problem}

%We consider the following assumptions for the simulation of our approach:
\subsection{Assumptions}
In the development of this approach, the following assumptions are made:

\begin{enumerate}

    \item The motion of the multi-robot system begins at
    the instant $t_{init}$ and goes until the instant $t_{final}$.

    \item The team of robots consists of a set $\mathcal{R}$ of $B$
    nonholonomic mobile robots.
    
    \item A robot (denoted $R_b,\ R_b \in \mathcal{R},\ b \in \{0,\dots,B-1\}$) is 
    geometrically represented by a circle of radius $\rho_b$ centered at
    $(x_b, y_b)$.
        
    \item All obstacles in the environment are considered static. They can be
    represented by a set $\mathcal{O}$ of $M$ static obstacles.
    
    \item An obstacle (denoted $O_m,\ $\mbox{$O_m \in \mathcal{O}$}$,\ $
    \mbox{$m \in \{0,\ \dots, M-1\}$}) is geometrically represented either as
    a circle or as a convex polygon. In the case of a circle its radius is
    denoted $r_{O_m}$ centered at $(x_{O_m},y_{O_m})$.
    
    \item For a given instant $t_k \in [t_{init},\ t_{final}]$, any obstacle
    $O_m$ having its geometric center apart from the geometric center of the
    robot $R_b$ of a distance inferior than the detection radius $d_{b,sen}$
    of the robot $R_b$ is considered detected by this robot.
    Therefore, this obstacle is part of the set $\mathcal{O}_b$
    ($\mathcal{O}_b \subset \mathcal{O}$) of detected obstacles.
    
    \item A robot has precise knowledge of the position and geometric 
    representation of a detected obstacle, i.e., obstacles perception issues
    are neglected.
    
    \item A robot can access 
    information about any robot in the team by using 
    a wireless communication link.
    
    \item Latency, communication outages and other problems associated
    to the communication between robots in the team are neglected.
        
    \item Dynamics was neglected.
    
    \item The input of a mobile robot $R_b$ is limited.
    
%    \item The motion planner in a robot $R_b$ (with $n \in {0,\dots,B-1}$) has
%    access to the following information:
%    \begin{enumerate}
%        \item current and past configuration of the robot $R_b$;
%        \item $R_b$'s goal configuration;
%        \item $R_b$'s input limits;
%        \item The map function to pass from flat space to state and input space and
%        its inverse;
%        \item  
%    \end{enumerate}

%     as well as the its robot's goal configuration, the input limits,
%    its kinematic
%    model and bijective mapping function for passing from the flat space to the
%    actual state and input spaces;
%    
%    \item Each robot have sensors that can detect the surrounding region within a
%    radius $\rho_d$. Any object having its geometric center within this region is
%    considered detect by the robot;

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Constraints and cost functions}

After introducing the motion planning problem in
Section~\ref{sec:intro} and giving the assumptions in the previous Subsection,
we can define the constraints and the cost function for the
multi-robot navigation.

\begin{enumerate}

    \item The solution of the motion planning problem
    for the robot $R_b$ represented by the pair
    $(q^{*}_b(t), u^{*}_b(t))$ --
    $q^{*}_b(t) \in \mathbb{R}^n$ being the solution trajectory for
    the robot's configuration and $u^{*}_b(t) \in \mathbb{R}^p$ the solution
    trajectory for the robot's input -- must satisfy the
    robots kinematic model equation:   
%    For a robot $R_b$     
%    its kinematic model equation
%    must hold for a computed solution to the
%    motion planning problem:
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:kinematic}
        \dot{q}^{*}_b(t) = f(q^{*}_b(t),u^{*}_b(t)),\quad \forall t \in [t_{init}, t_{final}].
    \end{equation}
%	with $q^{*}_b(t) \in \mathbb{R}^n$ the solution 
%	trajectory for the robot's configuration,
%	$u^{*}_b(t) \in \mathbb{R}^p$ the solution trajectory
%	for the robot's input and
%	\mbox{$f\,:\,\mathbb{R}^{n}\times \mathbb{R}^{p}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$} the
%	vector-valued function modelling the robot 
%	kinematics.
    
    \item The planned initial configuration and initial 
    input for the robot $R_b$ must
    be equal to the initial configuration and initial
    input of $R_b$:
    \begin{equation}
        q^{*}_{b}(t_{init}) = q_{b,init},
    \end{equation}
    \begin{equation}
        u^{*}_{b}(t_{init}) = u_{b,init}.
    \end{equation}

    \item The planned final configuration and final 
    input for the robot $R_b$ must
    be equal to the goal configuration and goal
    input for $R_b$:
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:finalconfig}
        q^{*}_{b}(t_{final}) = q_{b,goal},
    \end{equation}
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:finalinput}
        u^{*}_{b}(t_{final}) = u_{b,goal}.
    \end{equation}

    \item Practical limitations of the input impose
    the following constraint: $\forall t \in [t_{init}, t_{final}]$, $\forall i \in [1,2,\cdots, p]$,
    \begin{equation}
        |u^{*}_{b,i}(t)| \leq u_{b,i,max}.
    \end{equation}
    
    \item The cost for the multi-robot system navigation is defined as:
    \begin{equation}
        L(q(t),u(t)) = \sum_{b=0}^{B-1}L_b(q_b(t), u_b(t), q_{b,goal},u_{b,goal})
    \end{equation}
    where $L_b(q_b(t), u_b(t), q_{b,goal},u_{b,goal})$ is the 
    integrated cost for one robot
    motion planning (see~\cite{Defoort2009}).
    
    \item 
    %TODO define the functions "distance" robot-to-obstacle:
    To ensure collision avoidance with obstacles, the euclidean 
    distance between
    a robot and an obstacle (denoted $\mathrm{d}(R_b, O_m)\ |\ O_m
    \in \mathcal{O}_b, R_b \in \mathcal{B} $) has to satisfy:
    \begin{equation}
    	\mathrm{d}(R_b, O_m) \geq 0.
    \end{equation}
    
    For the circle representation of an obstacle the distance
    $\mathrm{d}(R_b, O_m)$ is defined as:
    \begin{equation*}
        \sqrt{(x_{b} - x_{O_m})^2 + (y_{b} - y_{\mathrm{O}_m})^2}  - \rho_b - r_{O_m}.
    \end{equation*}
    
    For the convex polygon representation, the distance was calculated
    using three different
    definitions, according to the Voronoi region~\cite{ericson2004real}
    $R_b$ is located. Voronoi regions are 
    defined by
    the lines containing the sides ($s$ lines) and by the lines passing
    through the vertexes that are orthogonal to the sides ($r$ lines) of
    the convex polygon. 
    Figure~\ref{fig:convexpolygon} shows an
    quadrilateral $ABCD$ representation of an obstacle where three of the nine
    regions were distinguished. 
    %Each of these three region are 
%     For a generic convex polygon three different
%    kinds of regions can be defined. 
    
%    One kind is defined by the two lines passing 
%    through a vertix, another by one line passing through two consecutive vertese
%     Figure~\ref{fig:convexpolygon} shows an
%    quadrilateral $ABCD$ representation of the obstacle where three of the nine . For this
%    representation three different kinds of regions can be define.
    
    
%    regions he three kinds
%    of regions for a quadrilateral $ABCD$ representation.    
    
	In this example, the region in which the robot $R_b$ is located
	at an instant $t_k$
	can be computed by evaluating the line
 	equations 
 	$s_{AB}$, $s_{BC}$, $s_{CD}$, $s_{DA}$, $r_{AB}$, $r_{AD}$, $r_{BA}$, $r_{BA}$,
 	$r_{BC}$, $r_{BA}$, $r_{BC}$, $r_{CB}$, $r_{CD}$, $r_{DC}$ and $r_{DA}$ for 
 	the position associated with the configuration $q^*_b(t_k)$.
 	
%    The region which the position associated with a given configuration $q_b$
%    is in can be computed as follows.
    
    In addition, the distance
    robot-to-quadrilateral is computed as follows:
    \begin{enumerate}
    
	   	\item If robot in region $1$:
   	   	\begin{equation*}
    	    \sqrt{(x_{b} - x_{A})^2 + (y_{b} - y_{A})^2} - \rho_b
	    \end{equation*}
	    which is simply the distance of the robot to the vertex $A$.
	    
	    \item If robot in region $2$:
%	    
		\begin{equation*}
			\mathrm{d}(s_{DA}, (x_{b}, y_{b})) - \rho_b
		\end{equation*}
		where
   	   	\begin{equation*}
    	    \mathrm{d}(s_{DA}, (x_{b}, y_{b})) =\\ \frac{|a_{s_{DA}}x_{b} + b_{s_{DA}}y_{b}
    	    + c_{s_{DA}}|}{\sqrt{a_{s_{DA}}^2 + b_{s_{DA}}^2}}.
	    \end{equation*}
	    
	    The distance $\mathrm{d}(s_{DA}, (x_{b}, y_{b}))$ represents the distance from the robot to the side $DA$.
	    
	    \item If robot in region $3$:
   	   	\begin{equation*}
    	    -\min\left(\mathrm{d}(s_{AB}, (x_{b}, y_{b})), \cdots, \mathrm{d}(s_{DA}, (x_{b}, y_{b}))\right) - \rho_b
	    \end{equation*}
	    which represents the amount of penetration of the robot in the obstacle.
	    
    \end{enumerate}
    
    The distance computation for other regions can be easily 
    inferred from the above equations.

    In order to prevent inter-robot collisions, the following constraint must be respected:
    $\forall\ (R_b, R_c) \in \mathcal{R} \times \mathcal{R}, b\neq c, c \in \mathcal{C}_b$,
    %o a robot $R_b$ avoid collision with other robots the following
    %relation must be satisfied. 
%    In order to avoid inter-robot collision the following constraint
%    must be respect by the robots $R_b$ and $R_b$:
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:coll}
	    \mathrm{d}(R_b,R_c) - \rho_b -\rho_c \geq 0
    \end{equation}
    where $\mathrm{d}(R_b,R_c) = \sqrt{(x_{b} - x_{c})^2 + (y_{b} - y_{c})^2}$ and

    $\mathcal{D}_b$ is the set of robots that present a communication lost risk with

\section{Distributed motion planning}



\subsection{Receding horizon approach}\label{subsec:rha}

%Defoort give in \cite{    Defoort2007a} an example showing how a unicycle model 
%can be written using the flatness property.
%The basis algorithm for planning for a mono robot is based on the optimization 
%problem shown in equations~\ref{eq:} and~\ref{eq:}.
%TODO present method or make reference to Defoort introducing $T_c$, $T_p$ etc.

Since the environment is progressively perceived by the robots and new obstacles may appear as time passes,
planning the whole motion from initial to goal configurations at a moment
previous to the beginning of the motion is
not a satisfying approach. Planning locally and replanning is 
a more suitable approach for taking new information, as they come, into account. Besides, the computation cost of finding a motion plan using
the first approach may be prohibited high if the planning complexity depends
on the distance between start and goal configurations.


Therefore, an on-line planner that computes the configuration and input 
trajectories as the multi-robot system evolves in the environment is proposed.
One possible way to do so is to use a receding horizon control approach~\cite{Keviczky2006}.

Two fundamental concepts of this approach are the planning horizon $T_p$ and 
update/computation horizon $T_c$. $T_p$ is the timespan for which a solution 
will be computed and
$T_c$ is the time horizon during which a plan is executed while the
next plan, for the next timespan $T_p$, is being computed.
The problem of producing a motion plan during a $T_c$ time interval is called
here a receding horizon planning problem.

For each receding horizon planning problem the following is done:
\paragraph{Step 1.}\label{step1} All robots in the team compute an intended solution trajectory (denoted $(\hat{q}_b(t), \hat{u}_b(t))$)
by ignoring coupling
constraints, that is, constraints \ref{eq:coll} and \ref{eq:com} that involve 
other robots in the team.
\paragraph{Step 2.}\label{step2} Robots involved in a potential conflict (i.e. risk of collision 
or lost of communication) update their trajectories computed during \nameref{step1} by solving another constrained optimization problem
that additionally takes into account
coupling constraints (\ref{eq:coll} and \ref{eq:com}).
This is done by using the other robots' intended
trajectories computed in the previous step as an estimate of those robots'
final trajectories. If a robot is not involved in any conflict, \nameref{step2}
is not executed and its final
solution trajectory is identical to the one estimated in \nameref{step1}.

\mbox{}

All robots in the team use the same $T_p$ and $T_c$ for assuring synchronization when exchanging information about their positions and intended trajectories.

For each of these steps and for each robot in the team one constrained optimization problem is resolved. The cost function to be minimized in those
optimization problems
%, proposed in \cite{Defoort2007a}
is the distance of a robot's current configuration to its goal configuration.
This assures that the robots are driven towards their goal configurations.

This two step scheme is explained in details in~\cite{Defoort2007a} where 
constrained optimization problems associated to the receding horizon 
optimization problem are formulated.

However, constraints related to the goal configuration and goal input of the motion planning problem are
neglected in the receding horizon scheme presented in~\cite{Defoort2007a}.
Constraints~\ref{eq:finalconfig} and~\ref{eq:finalinput} are left out
in the receding horizon scheme.
For taking them into account, a termination procedure is proposed in the following that enables the robots to reach their goal state.



\subsection{Motion planning termination}



As the robots evolve in the environment using the decentralized receding horizon planning, their configuration approximate to the goal configuration.
%That is so because the  since the distance between current and final state is what is to 
%be minimized.
But simply stopping the motion planner as the robots are in the neighbourhood 
of their final configuration is not a satisfying approach (it leaves 
constraints~\ref{eq:finalconfig} and~\ref{eq:finalinput} unsatisfied).

%Furthermore, the use of a constant planning horizon $T_p$ prevents the robot of
%finding 

Therefore, after stopping the receding horizon planning algorithm, we propose a 
termination planning that considers those constraints associated to 
the goal state
%in the \textbf{termination optimization problem}
and that plans for unknown, to be determined planning horizon. This enables
the robots to reach their goal states.

%The constraints associated to the final configuration and input have to be integrated 
%into the optimization problem. In addition, the timespan for performing this last
%termination plan cannot be constant and must be one of the values to be calculated.
%The fixed planning horizon has to be made variable in order to get to the 

The criterion used to pass from the receding 
horizon planning to the termination planning is based on the distance between
goal and current position of the robots and is defined in the
equation~\ref{eq:stopcond}:

\begin{align}\label{eq:stopcond}
  d_{rem} \geq d_{min} + T_c \cdot v_{max}
\end{align}

This condition ensures that the termination plan will be planned for at least a 
$d_{min}$ distance from the robot's goal position.
This minimal distance is assumed to be sufficient for the robot to reach the 
goal configuration.

After stopping the receding horizon planning, we calculate new parameters for 
the solution representation and computation taking into
account the estimate remaining distance and the typical distance traveled
for a $T_p$ planning horizon (as better explained in TODO REF).
This is done in order to rescale the configuration intended for a previous 
planning horizon not necessarily equal to the new one. Potentially, this
rescaling will decrease the computation time for the termination planning.

The following pseudo code~\ref{cod:algo} summarizes the planning algorithm    
and the Figure~\ref{fig:recedinghor} illustrates how plans would be generated
through time by the algorithm.

In the pseudo code, we see the call of a {\scshape PlanSec} procedure.
It corresponds to the resolution of the receding horizon planning 
problem as defined in subsection~\ref{subsec:rha}.

{\scshape PlanLastSec} is the procedure solving the termination planning
problem. This problem is similar to the receding horizon planning problems.
It also has the two steps presented before for computing an intended plan and
for updating it, if need be, so conflicts are avoided.
The difference consists in how the optimization problems associated to it are 
defined. The optimization problem defined in equations \ref{eq:costsa} and
\ref{eq:constsa} is the problem solved at the first step which generates an
intended plan.
%(denoted ($\hat{q}_b(t)$, $\hat{u}_b(t)$))
The optimization
problem associated with the update step is defined in equations 
\ref{eq:cost} and \ref{eq:const} and produces the final solution ($q^*_b(t)$, $u^*_b(t)$).
Besides, in both new constrained optimal problems the planning horizon is not
a fixed constant as before, instead it is a part of the solution to be found.

So, for generating the intended plan:

\begin{align}\label{eq:costsa}
\underset{\hat{q}_b(t),\hat{u}_b(t),T_f}{\mathrm{min}} L_{b,f}(\hat{q}_b(t), \hat{u}_b(t), q_{b,goal},u_{b,goal})
\end{align}

under the following constraints for $\tau_k = kT_c$ with $k$ the number of receding horizon
problems solved before the termination problem:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:constsa}
\left\lbrace\begin{array}{lcl}
    \dot{\hat{q}}_b(t) = f(\hat{q}_b(t),\hat{u}_b(t)),\ \ \forall t \in [\tau_{k}, \tau_{k}+T_f]\\
    \hat{q}_b(\tau_{k}) = q^*_{b}(\tau_{k-1}+T_c)\\
    \hat{u}_b(\tau_{k}) = u^*_{b}(\tau_{k-1}+T_c)\\
    \hat{q}_b(\tau_{k}+T_f) = q_{b,goal}\\
    \hat{u}_b(\tau_{k}+T_f) = u_{b,goal}\\
    |\hat{u}_{b,i}(t)| \leq u_{b,i,max},\ \ \forall i \in [1,p],\forall t \in (\tau_{k}, \tau_{k}+T_f)\\
    d(R_b, O_m) \geq 0,\quad \forall O_m \in \mathcal{O}_b, t \in (\tau_{k}, \tau_{k}+T_f)
\end{array}\right.
\end{equation}

And for generating the final solution:

\begin{align}\label{eq:cost}
\underset{q^*_b(t),u^*_b(t),T_f}{\mathrm{min}} L_{b,f}(q^*_b(t), u^*_b(t), q_{b,goal},u_{b,goal})
\end{align}

under the following constraints:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:const}
\left\lbrace\begin{array}{lcl}
    \dot{q^*}_b(t) = f(q^*_b(t),u^*_b(t)),\ \ \forall t \in [\tau_{k}, \tau_{k}+T_f]\\
    q^*_b(\tau_{k}) = q^*_{b}(\tau_{k-1}+T_c)\\
    u^*_b(\tau_{k}) = u^*_{b}(\tau_{k-1}+T_c)\\
    q^*_b(\tau_{k}+T_f) = q_{b,goal}\\
    u^*_b(\tau_{k}+T_f) = u_{b,goal}\\
    |u^*_{b,i}(t)| \leq u_{b,i,max},\ \ \forall i \in [1,p],\forall t \in (\tau_{k}, \tau_{k}+T_f)\\
    d(R_b, O_m) \geq 0,\ \ \forall O_m \in \mathcal{O}_b, \forall t \in (\tau_{k}, \tau_{k}+T_f)\\
    \mathrm{d}(R_b, R_c) - \rho_b - \rho_c \geq 0,\ \ \forall R_c \in \mathcal{C}_b, \forall t \in (\tau_{k}, \tau_{k}+T_f)\\
    \mathrm{d}(R_b, R_d) - \min(d_{b,com},d_{d,com}) \geq 0,\ \ \forall R_d \in \mathcal{D}_b,\\
    \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \forall t \in (\tau_{k}, \tau_{k}+T_f)\\
    \mathrm{d}(q^*_b(t), \hat{q}_b(t)) \leq \xi,\ \ \forall t \in (\tau_{k}, \tau_{k}+T_f)
\end{array}\right.
\end{equation}

A possible definition for the $L_{b,f}$ cost function present in the equations above can be simply $T_f$.
The sets $\mathcal{O}_b$, $\mathcal{C}_b$ and $\mathcal{D}_b$ are functions of
$\tau_k$.

\subsection{Strategies for solving the constrained optimization problems}



\subsubsection{Flatness property}

As explained in~\cite{Defoort2007a}, all mobile robots consisting of a solid
block in motion can be modeled as a flat system. 
This means that a change of variables is possible in a way that states and
inputs of the kinematic model of the mobile robot can be written in terms
of a new variable, called flat output ($z$), and its $l$th first derivatives.
The value of $l$ depending on kinematic model.
Therefore, the behavior of the system can be completely determined by the flat
output.

%\begin{figure}[!h]\centering
%  \includegraphics[width=.7\linewidth]{./images/flatness.png} %
%  \caption{Flatness\label{fig:flatness}}
%\label{fig:res}
%\end{figure}

Searching for a solution to our problem in the flat space rather than in
the actual configuration space of the system presents advantages.
It prevents the need for integrating the differential equations
of system (constraint ~\ref{eq:kinematic}) and reduces the dimension of the 
problem of finding an optimal admissible trajectory.
After finding (optimal) trajectories in the flat space, it is possible
to retrieve back the original configuration and input trajectories.
%as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:flatness}.

\subsubsection{Parametrization of the flat output by B-splines}

Another important aspect of this approach is the parametrization of 
the flat output trajectory. As done in~\cite{milam2003}, the use
of B-spline functions present interesting properties:


\begin{itemize}


 \item It is possible to specify a level of continuity $C^k$ when using
 B-splines without additional constraints.
 
 \item B-spline presents a local support -- changes in parameters values have a 
 local impact on the resulting curve.
 
 
\end{itemize}

The first property is very well suited for parametrizing the flat output since
its $l$th first derivatives will be needed when computing the system actual state
and input trajectories. The second property is important when searching for an
admissible solution in the flat space; such parametrization is more efficient
and well-conditioned than, for instance, a polynomial parametrization.

TODO cite Millan?

\subsubsection{Optimization solver}

There exists a variety of numerical optimization packages implemented in many different programming languages available for solving optimization problems~\cite{pyopt-paper}.

Obviously not all of those implementations are suited for solving
the particular kind of optimization problems presented before.

As explained in~\ref{Defoort2009} a Feasible Sequential Quadratic Programming is best suited for solving the motion
planning problem as stated in thins paper. 
This class of solvers compute at every iteration solution
that respects the problem constraints.

TODO keep explaining, present SLSQL and ALGENCAN, present reasons why we used SLSQP (i.e. availability in python, free license, and faster then ALGENCAN)

\section{Simulation results}

Here we show the results and analyses founded for the motion planner presented
in the previous sections.

The trajectory and velocities shown in the Figures~\ref{fig:collision} and~\ref{fig:nocollision}
illustrate a motion planning solution found for a team of three robots.
The robots move in an environment where three static obstacles are present.
Each point along the trajectory line of a robot represents the beginning
of a $Tc$ computation horizon.

In Figure~\ref{fig:collision} we show the resulting plan when coupling constraints
are ignored (\nameref{step2} is never performed). In Figure~\ref{fig:nocollision}
we have a collision-free solution. The blue zones in Figure~\ref{fig:nocollision} are in the same position as the red ones in Figure~\ref{fig:collision}. Specially near these regions a change in the trajectory is present. Complementary, changes in the robots velocities across charts in both figures can be notice. Finally, the bottom charts show that the collisions were indeed avoid: inter-robot distances in Figure~\ref{fig:nocollision} are greater then or equal to zero all along the simulation.
%The trajectories and
%velocities resulting from the solution update.

\label{fig:res}
\end{figure}

For performing these two previous simulations a reasonable number of parameters have to be set. These parameters can be categorized into two groups. The \textbf{algorithm related} parameters and the \textbf{optimization solver related} ones.
Among the former group, the most important ones are:
\begin{itemize}
\item[$\bullet$] The number of sample for time discretization ($N_s$);
\item[$\bullet$] The number of internal knots for the B-splines curves ($n_{knots}$);
\item[$\bullet$] The planning horizon for the sliding window ($T_p$);
\item[$\bullet$] The computation horizon ($T_c$).
\end{itemize}

The latter kind depends on the numeric optimization solver adopted.
However, since most of them are iterative methods, it is common
to have at least the two following parameters:
\begin{itemize}
\item[$\bullet$] Maximum number of iterations;
\item[$\bullet$] Stop condition.
\end{itemize}

%The task of searching for a satisfactory set of parameters' values with regard to a performance metric (e.g. total time to complete the miss1ion) is quite laborious.

This considerable number of parameters having influence on the solution
and/or on the time for finding a solution makes the search for a
satisfactory set of parameters' values a laborious task.

Thus, it is important to have a better understanding of how some
performance criteria are impacted by the changes in algorithm
parameters.

\subsection{Parameters' impact analyses}

Three criteria considered important for the validation of this method were studied.
We tested different parameters configuration and scenario in order to 
understand how they influence
those criteria.
The three criteria defined for a given robot $R_b$ are:

\begin{itemize}

\item
\textit{Maximum computation time} over the computation horizon ($MCT/T_c$ 
ratio).

\item
Obstacle penetration area ($P$).

\item
Total execution time ($T_{tot}$).

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Detection radius impact}

As the detection radius of the robot increases more obstacles are
seen at once which, in turn,
increases the number of constraints in the optimization problems.
The impact of increasing the detection radius $d_{b,sen}$ in the computation
performance (\textit{Maximum computation time} over computation horizon $MCT/T_c$) can
be seen in the Figure~\ref{fig:drhormp} for a scenario where seven obstacles where present.
Naturally, the computation time stops increasing as the robot sees all obstacles present
in the environment.

\begin{figure}[!h]\centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{./images/drho/drho-rmp.pdf} % <-- use this
  %\rule{5cm}{5cm} % <-- this is just a black box substitute for graphics
  \caption{Increasing of detection radius and impact on a $MTC/T_c$ 
ratio\label{fig:drhormp}}
\end{figure}

Furthermore, the Figure~\ref{fig:drhotot} shows how the total time of execution
decreases as the radius increases pointing out how a better knowledge of the
environment produces a more optimal solution.

%As the detection radius of the robot increases more obstacles are
%seen at a time which, in turn,
%increases the number of constraints in the optimization problems.
%The impact of increasing the detection radius $d_{b,sen}$ in the computation
%performance (\textit{Maximum computation time} over computation horizon $MCT/T_c$) can
%be seen in the Figure~\ref{fig:drho}.

\begin{figure}[!h]\centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{./images/drho/drho-tot.pdf}
  \caption{Increasing of detection radius and impact on a $T_{tot}$ 
ratio\label{fig:drhotot}}
\end{figure}

These two behaviors indicate how a compromise between computation time and optimality must be found.

%The numbers that can be seen
%over the blue curve are the maximum number of obstacles seen at once during the whole mission.

\subsection{Maximum computation time over computation horizon $MCT/T_c$}

The significance of this criterion lays in the need of assuring the 
real-time property of this algorithm.
In a real implementation of this approach the computation horizon would have 
always to be superior than the
maximum time took for computing a plan (coupling constraints
taken into account).

Based on several simulations with different scenarios we were able to
produce the charts shown in the Figure~\ref{fig:uni3}
